# webpack-playlist - Lesson 4 - Babel Loaders

- Perform Transformations
- E.g. Babel loaders transform ES2015 or JS in vanilla JS
- Many more loaders for other things too (such as SASS or LESS)

# Using Babel Loader

- Install babel-core and babel-loader via npm
- Install any presets we will be using to perform transformations - es6 or es7 preset
- Configure webpack.config to tell webpack to use babel to transform our code

# Installing Babel
npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev
